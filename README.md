# unp4k [![Release](https://github.com/dolkensp/unp4k/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dolkensp/unp4k/actions/workflows/release.yaml)
These tools allow users to open, decrypt, and extract data from Star Citizen `.p4k` files.

# Installation:
1. Download `unp4k-suite-v3.3.x.zip`
2. Right click the zip and select *Properties*
3. Under the *General* tab, check the *Unblock* checkbox at the bottom if it exists, and click ok
4. Extract the selected zip to your desired installation directory

NOTE: unforge currently requires [.Net Framework 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net462) or greater to run. If you receive the error `Method not found: '!!0[] System.Array.Empty()'.` you will need to install this framework.

# Quickstart:

1. Drag `Data.p4k` from the `Starcitizen\LIVE` folder, directly onto `unp4k.exe`

# Advanced Command Line Usage:

1. Launch a command line, and navigate to the unp4k directory
2. Execute `unp4k.exe c:\path\to\data.p4k [filter]` where filter is a keyword used to filter the results (the default filter is `*.*`)

NOTE: The filter does not fully support wildcards. To extract files of a certain type, you may use `*.ext` as the filter, but no further wildcard functionality exists.

# Basic GUI Usage:

1. Launch `unp4k.gui.exe`
2. Select `File` > `Open` and browse to your chosen `Data.p4k`
3. Browse the file structure
4. Right click to extract/open files

NOTE: unp4k.gui is early alpha, and has many crashes, and unfinished features. Use at your own risk

# File Format Overview:

The p4k files used by Star Citizen are Zip archives.

Star Citizen supports data in multiple modes inside the archive, including STORE, DEFLATE, and custom support for ZSTD.

Star Citizen also implements bespoke encryption over *some* of the data inside the archive - this can all be decrypted with the same public key that is utilized by CryEngine based games for various encryption routines within the engine.

Inside the p4k file, XML files are often stored as CryXML rather than raw XML.

CryXML is a basic serialized XML format which `unforge.exe` is able to deserialize.

Inside the p4k file, there is also a `game.dcb` file, which is a bespoke database format, with similarities to CryXML.

This is the product of what is known internally as "DataForge", and is also able to be converted/extracted using the `unforge.exe` tool.
